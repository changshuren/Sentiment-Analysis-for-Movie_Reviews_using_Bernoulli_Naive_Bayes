# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Using Multinomial Naive Bayes

The IMDB movie reviews dataset was used to classify reviews as 'positive' or 'negative'. The data were divided into training and test sets. The training set contains 800 positive and 800 negative movie reviews whereas the test set contains 200 positive and 200 negative movie reviews. 

This was one of the first widely-available sentiment analysis datasets compiled by Pang and Lee's. The data was first collected in 2002, however, the text is similar to movies reviews you find on IMDB today. The dataset is in a CSV format. It has two categories: Pos (reviews that express a positive or favourable sentiment) and Neg (reviews that express a negative or unfavourable sentiment). All reviews are either positive or negative. There are no neutral reviews.

A Multinomial Naive Bayes classification model was built and trained in Python to predict the accuracy.
